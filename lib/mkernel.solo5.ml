(* The behaviour of our select is a little different from what we're used to
   seeing. Currently, only a read on a net device can produce a necessary
   suspension (the reception of packets on the network).

   However, a special case concerns the block device. Reading and writing to it
   can take time. It can be interesting to suspend these actions and actually
   do them when we should be waiting (as long as a sleeper is active or until
   an event appears).

   The idea is to suspend these actions so that we can take the opportunity to
   do something else and actually do them when we have the time to do so: when
   Miou has no more tasks to do and when we don't have any network events to
   manage.

   The implication of this would be that our unikernels would be limited by I/O
   on block devices. They won't be able to go any further than reading and
   writing to block devices. As far as I/O on net devices is concerned, we are
   only limited by the OCaml code that has to handle incoming packets. Packet
   writing, on the other hand, is direct. *)

           rather than observing events regularly. This decreases the
           availability of the unikernel but improves performance.

           One option might be to force event monitoring according to the [utcp]
